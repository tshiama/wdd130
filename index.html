 <p>Hey everyone,
    Hope you’re all doing well! I’m Celestin Tshiama. I’m from Lexington in Kentucky state. I’ve heard so much about the wonderful projects we have lined up, and I’m super excited to be a part of this journey with everyone. Outside of work, I’m a massive fan of nature and often find myself exploring new places, and I spend my free time with my family. If anyone’s up for a chat please fil free, hit me up!
